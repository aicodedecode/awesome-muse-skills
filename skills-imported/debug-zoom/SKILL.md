Debug Zoom auth, API, webhook, SDK, or connector issues without wandering through the entire docs set.

## Usage

```text
/debug-zoom $ARGUMENTS
```

## Workflow

1. Identify the failing layer: auth, API request, webhook, SDK init, media/session behavior, or connector transport.
2. Ask for the minimum missing evidence: exact error, platform, request/response, event payload, or code path.
3. Produce 2-4 plausible causes ranked by likelihood.
4. Route to the most relevant deep references in `skills/`.
5. Give a short verification plan so the user can confirm the fix.

## Output

- Most likely failure layer
- Ranked hypotheses
- Targeted fix steps
- Verification checklist
- Relevant skill links
