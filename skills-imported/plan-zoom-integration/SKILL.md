Create a practical build plan for a Zoom integration or app.

## Usage

```text
/plan-zoom-integration $ARGUMENTS
```

## Workflow

1. Capture the target user flow and success criteria.
2. Choose the correct Zoom surface and supporting services.
3. Define auth requirements, scopes, and account assumptions.
4. Break implementation into phases: prototype, core integration, reliability, and launch.
5. Call out hard risks early: OAuth setup, webhook verification, SDK environment limits, marketplace review, or connector client constraints.
6. End with the smallest deliverable that proves the architecture.

## Output

- Architecture summary
- Zoom products and APIs required
- Auth and scope checklist
- Delivery phases
- Risks, open questions, and immediate next action
